# ItemListApp

Item List App allows the user to create nested lists in a hierarchical tree structure. Each list has its name and value (automatically
generated). Using app's interface user can create new lists, sort (ascending/descending order) or sum the item values of any chosen
list.

Item list structure looks like this:

Item names go in an increasing alphabetical order, with inner list inheriting its parent name and adding to it, making every
item unique and easily identifiable.

To run this application, clone the repo and make sure WPF application (ListExe) is set to be a start-up project for the solution and not
the ItemListLibrary. Also make sure to add a reference in 'ListExe' to class 'ItemListLibrary' if it is not there already.
